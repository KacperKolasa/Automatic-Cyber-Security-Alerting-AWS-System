# Automatic Cyber Security AWS Alert System

## Description
An automated system to monitor, detect, and alert users of security events in AWS using GuardDuty, SNS, and CloudWatch. This repository provides both manual setup instructions through the AWS Console and automated setup using Terraform.

## Features
- Continuous monitoring with AWS GuardDuty
- Real-time notifications using Amazon SNS
- Customizable alerts with CloudWatch
- Simulated incident testing with GuardDuty sample findings

## Technologies Used
- AWS GuardDuty
- Amazon SNS
- Amazon CloudWatch
- Terraform

## Setup Instructions
Choose your preferred setup method:
- [Manual Setup via AWS Console](docs/manual-setup.md)
- [Automated Setup via Terraform](docs/terraform-setup.md)

## Usage

Once the system is set up, you can use it to monitor and receive alerts for security events in your AWS environment. Hereâ€™s how to interact with and test the system:

#### 1. Generate Sample Findings

To simulate a security incident and test the notification system:
- Navigate to the AWS GuardDuty console.
- Use the option to generate sample findings.
- GuardDuty will create several sample findings that simulate various security events.

#### 2. Receive Notifications

Once sample findings are generated:
- Check your email (or phone) for notifications.
- The notifications should correspond to the findings generated by GuardDuty.

#### 3. Adjust Notification Settings

If you need to adjust the notification settings:
- Modify the SNS topic subscriptions to add or remove email/phone numbers.
- Update the CloudWatch alarm thresholds and actions as needed.

#### 4. Review Findings and Respond

For each finding:
- Review the details in the GuardDuty console.
- Take appropriate action to investigate and mitigate the issue.

#### 5. Clean Up

If you want to remove the setup:
- For the Terraform setup, run `terraform destroy` in the `terraform` directory.
- Manually delete resources through the AWS Console if set up manually.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Automatic Cyber Security Alerting AWS System is properly monitoring your environment and that you are promptly notified of any significant security events.
